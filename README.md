# Calum's Dotfiles

## Setup

This setup is current as of August 2025.

- iTerm 2 + zsh
- chezmoi
- brew


Other notable apps that I use:

- 1Password
- Tailscale

# Setup new computer

```bash
# run the bootstrap.sh (requires brew)
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calumpwebb/dotfiles/main/bootstrap.sh)"
```

NOTE: haven't tracked /etc/ssh/sshd_config yet... to do later
